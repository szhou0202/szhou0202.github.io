    <!-- December 23 2024<br> -->

    Constant learning and growth brings me a lot of happiness and fulfillment :). <img style="width: 60px" src="files/minions.gif"> <br>
    <!-- I'm really excited to think about cooler and cooler things as life goes on. <br> -->

    <!-- December 22 2024<br>  -->
    <!-- Having this page now really encourages me to brain dump. <br>
    Life is tough but good. <br> 
    The modern world is overflowing with information, some of which is really interesting and inspiring, and 
    some of which is brainrot. It takes work to filter through all that.<br>
    There is so much potential to create, and I couldn't have the time to do everything 
    I would possibly want. It's best to just sit down and do a certain thing. <br>
    Can you support people only in parts? Can you love someone but not love something they do? 
    This is related to that age-old moral question. <br>  -->
    <!-- Still thinking about how to layout this website. <br>  -->
    Dostoevsky and the translator I read somehow pinpoint the thoughts and feelings of the MC of "White Nights"
    so precisely in their use of language that I'm sure I felt precisely the same loneliness and turmoil as the MC 
    while I read him. Also, somehow, I expected it would end the way it did. It seemed too good to be true.
    How should the MC go on? How can he go on? I need to know. <br> <!-- What kind of life is worth living? Is his life worth living? -->

    Thank you to my friend who suggested I read things on my phone! <br> 

    <!-- Been thinking recently. It's good to document things. -->
