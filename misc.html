    December 22 2024<br> 
    Still thinking about how to layout this website. <br> 
    Dostoevsky and the translator I read somehow pinpoint the thoughts and feelings of the MC of "White Nights"
    so precisely in their use of language that I'm sure I felt precisely the same loneliness and turmoil as the MC 
    while I read him. Also, somehow, I expected it would end the way it did. It seemed too good to be true.
    How should the MC go on? How can he go on? I need to know. <br> <!-- What kind of life is worth living? Is his life worth living? -->

    Thank you to my friend who suggested I read things on my phone! <br> 

    Been thinking recently. It's good to document things.
